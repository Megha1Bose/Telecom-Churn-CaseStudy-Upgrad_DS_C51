This case study aims to identify potential customers responsible for churn and all the predictors that drive churning in a telecom industry

Telecom Churn Prediction case study
Business problem overview
Customers for telecommunication industry are able to choose from multiple service providers and options to switch from one operator to another. This highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. 
Fact– It takes costs of 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition. 
Business Goal - For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this project, analysis is done for customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, built predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn.
Understanding and Defining Churn
There are two main models of payment in the telecom industry – 
a)	Postpaid model (customers pay a monthly/annual bill after using the services) when customers want to switch to another operator, they usually inform the existing operator to terminate the services, and you directly know that this is an instance of churn.

b)	Prepaid model customers who want to switch to another network can simply stop using the services without any notice, and it is hard to know whether someone has actually churned or is simply not using the services temporarily (e.g. someone may be on a trip abroad for a month or two and then intend to resume using the services again). Thus, churn prediction is usually more critical (and non-trivial) for prepaid customers, and the term ‘churn’ should be defined carefully.
Important Note - prepaid is the most common model in India and southeast Asia, while postpaid is more common in Europe in North America. This project is based on the Indian and Southeast Asian market.
